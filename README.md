Otherwise, install Godot 4.3, open the project folder and run the game.

Controls for the game are:

- SPACE: Jump  
- Q: Dash

<h2><strong style="color:#d70087;">Summary of Workflow</strong></h2>

Workflow will be done via a git merge workflow. The master branch will contain the documentation and a good copy of the game. Any features to be implemented will be done in their own branches. These branches will then be merged into the master branch when complete.
