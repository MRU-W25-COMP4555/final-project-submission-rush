<h2><strong style="color:#d70087;">Summary of Workflow</strong></h2>

Workflow will be done via a git merge workflow. The master branch will contain the documentation and a good copy of the game. Any features to be implemented will be done in their own branches. These branches will then be merged into the master branch when complete.


### File Case

Files will be in camelCase


### Git Workflow
In General Feature Implementations should go like this:

- checkout the dev branch. 
- Create a new branch of the dev branch```bash git checkout feature-name-branch```
- Implement your feature.
- Switch back to **dev** branch ```bash git checkout dev```
- Perform merge ```bash git merge feature-name-branch ```
